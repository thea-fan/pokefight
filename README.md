Welcome to Pokefight!

This is a game of fighting randomly generated Pokemons and the aim is to figure out the correct and also most effective type of Pokemons to fight the enemy.

As the player plays the game, he or she will realise that while using certain types of Pokemon can successfully decrease the health level of the opponent Pokemon, using the wrong types - that is, using the types that have zero defense and are the most vulnerable to the attacks of the enemy - will result in them depleting their own health instead.

At the end of each health bar, one life will be deducted and a player has 5 lives each round.


The game is created with HTML, CSS and JS. JS dictates the main game structure and logic, whereby the it is largely built on the mechanism of callback functions which sends users' inputs into a series of interrelated processing, DOM manipulations to aid with the display and visual aspect of the game, and condition-checking methods to determine a win or loss outcome.
